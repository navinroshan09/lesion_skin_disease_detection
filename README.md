#🧠 Lesion Skin Disease Detection Using Deep Learning (Mini Project)
##📌 Project Overview

Lesion Skin Disease Detection is a deep learning–based web application designed to classify skin lesions as Benign or Malignant using medical image analysis.

This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Ensemble Learning techniques to improve prediction accuracy and reliability. The system provides real-time prediction results along with confidence levels through an interactive web interface.

Additionally, the application integrates:

🔐 User Authentication (PostgreSQL)
🤖 Cloud-hosted AI model (Hugging Face)

The goal of this project is to assist in early-stage skin cancer detection by providing an AI-powered diagnostic support tool.

##🎯 Objective
