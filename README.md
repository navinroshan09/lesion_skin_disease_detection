#🩺 Skin Lesion Disease Detection System

This project is a web-based application that helps in the early detection of skin lesion diseases using Artificial Intelligence. The system allows users to upload an image of a skin lesion, and it automatically analyzes the image to determine whether the lesion is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).

The application uses deep learning models trained on skin images to recognize patterns associated with different types of lesions. To improve accuracy and reliability, multiple models are combined using ensemble learning. The results are displayed through a simple and user-friendly web interface, showing both the prediction result and confidence level.

This project aims to support early diagnosis, awareness, and decision-making, especially in situations where immediate medical consultation may not be available. It is intended for educational and research purposes and does not replace professional medical advice.
